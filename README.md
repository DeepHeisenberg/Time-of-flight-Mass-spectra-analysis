# Time-of-flight-Mass-spectra-analysis
1. Several APT and SIMS mass spectra peaks can be found in the  two folders: APT and SIMS
2. The  trained models are too big to be uploaded in the github, so one must train all the lightbgm model themself and  save the model in pickle format.
3. one can find the relevent training protocal under the folder: learning models
4. in the jupterbook, one can find a example of how ML-ToF is used in pratice
